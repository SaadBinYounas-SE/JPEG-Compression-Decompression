# JPEG-Compression-Decompression
This MATLAB project implements a JPEG image compressor and decompressor with a graphical user interface (GUI). It supports both grayscale and color images and uses core JPEG techniques such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Quantization, Zigzag Scanning, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), and Huffman Encoding/Decoding to compress and reconstruct images efficiently.
